- 👋 Hi, I’m @cb650R-DEV (brazilian)
- 👀 I’m interested in: motorcycles (my nickname speaks for me anyway), especial coffee and a great job as developer.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning front end developing, starting with {"html","css","js"} to push myself on learning the best I can, and grinding this learning for something bigger in the future
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on learning of everyone and supporting them with some helpful criticizing. Some times it really helps.
- 📫 How to reach me: e-mail > gabrielsantana2033@gmail.com /// cellphone number +55 (51) 991788741
